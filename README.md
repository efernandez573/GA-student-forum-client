# GA Student Forum #

GA Student Forum is an application designed for GA students to upload content that they found useful in **learning a new technology/skill**. Users can **upload links** and **screenshots** to tutorials/articles with information that was helpful for them to learn these new topics. I came up with this application because I thought it would be helpful to have one place where GA students can add content that is specific to the topics we learn in class.

 This app can also be translated to any platform or organization in that most organizations need a space to guide their employees when working on a team with people of various skill levels. My goal for this application was to **create a space online** where people within my cohort could have a **one stop shop** for uploading content that they found useful.

**Unsolved Issues**
I would like to add a feature that would allow the user to click on a card/div and be routed to the website url that is cited. I would also like to format the images on the card so that they are all the same size, this should be relatively easy to achieve with some time. I would have liked to add an upvote or downvote option for whether or not the linked website/tutorial was helpful and comments for each post.
