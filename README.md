# GA Student Forum #

GA Student Forum is a platform for uploading content that users found useful in **learning a new technology/skill**. Users can **upload links** and **screenshots** to tutorials/articles/ with information that was helpful for them to learn these new skills. This is particularly important in the context of a bootcamp because there are so many new technologies that are learned. This app can also be translated to any platform or organization in that most organizations need a space to guide their employees when working on a team with people of various skill levels. My goal for this application was to **create a space online** where people within my cohort could have a **one stop shop** for uploading content that they found useful.
